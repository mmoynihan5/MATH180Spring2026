(508) 626-4728  (I try to respond within 24 hours, Monday-Friday.)    Student Help Hours  Mondays 10am-11am and Thursdays 1:30pm-3:30pm   Important : I want to see you in student hours, and will happily make appointments with you outside of the regular hours. I'm also available by email and will respond within 24 hours, usually much sooner. There is little I enjoy more than discussing mathematics, so you are really doing me a favor by coming to see me.    Class meets  MWRF 11:30am - 12:20pm in HH 405    Course Description  A thorough preparation in the skills and topics needed to study calculus. After a review of polynomial and rational functions and their graphs, topics include inverse functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and trigonometric functions.    Prerequisite  Completion of MATH 123 Introduction to Functions with a minimum grade of C (2.00) or better, or a satisfactory score on the mathematics placement examination.    Homework  All homework will appear in MyOpenMath .    Textbook   Precalculus by OpenStax (2nd edition). Read Online    Reading Mathematics   Don’t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?   Paul Halmos        Grading   Homework  Homework is your opportunity to practice with feedback. I expect that you work on the homework frequently. Do not expect to complete assignments in a single sitting.  There are many outside resources (some good\/bad and some ethnical\/unethical) for completing math homework. You should work on the homework in a way that prepares you for exams. Our brains do not retain information that we don't work for.  To register for MyOpenMath , you will need the following.   Course Name:  MATH 180 Precalculus - Spring 2026 - FSU    Course ID:  304914    Enrollment Key:  moynihan180002S26       Standards-Based Grading (SBG)  This semester 50% of your grade will be based on how many of the learning objectives you complete during the quizzes and exams.   How will my Course Objectives grade be determined? Each objective will be scored on a 4-point scale and averaged like your GPA.    Obj. Grade  Points    Excellent  4    Proficient  3    Competent  2    Developing  1    No Evidence  0     How many reattempts do I have for each objective? You will have at most two attempts at each objective during the quizzes. You will also only be able to complete so many objectives during the in-person quizzes and exams. That will provide a limit on how many reattempts there are by the end of the semester. You will want to successfully complete some objectives on the first try to avoid falling behind. Also, the cumulative final exam is a third attempt at (most) objectives!   What is great about this? If you do not do well on the first attempt but you go back and learn the material, your better second attempt will be your grade! Knowing the material is the important thing and I do not want to penalize you for a mistake while learning.   Where do students go wrong with this style of grading? They focus too strongly on only the reattempts and save the new material for later. This then means they get a 0 on the first attempt and are back to the old style of grading where there is no chance to improve from constructive feedback.    Final Exam  The final exam will be cumulative. As you work through the semester, always keep this in mind. You need to grow beyond basic understand to see things at a deeper level. That is how you will retain them and be able to succeed on new problems!    Final Grades  The following percentage weights are used for calculating your weighted course average.    Category  Weight    Homework  10%    Course Objectives  50%    Midterm Exam  15%    Final Exam  25%    Final grades will be assigned based on the following scale. Students needing to take MATH 219 Calculus I are required to earn a C (2.00) or better in MATH 180 Precalculus.    Percentage  Grade    93-100  A    90-93  A-    87-90  B+    83-87  B    80-83  B-    77-80  C+    73-77  C    70-73  C-    67-70  D+    63-67  D    60-63  D-    Below 60  F       Course Policies   Make sure you familiarize yourself with the following course and university policies.    Attendance  Regular attendance is an expectation for all students in this course because attendance is important for learning the material. But attendance means more than simply physical presence. It also requires mental presence. Attend every class awake, on time, and ready to learn with cell phones and all other electronic devices off and out of sight.  There is no attendance grade. I expect you to take care of yourself and those around you. IF YOU ARE ILL, YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEND CLASS. Otherwise, I expect to see you in class.    Late work  Make-up exams should be a rare occurrence reserved for illness and\/or emergencies. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed. In particular, I will consider recent attendance and recent homework to see if you have been participating in the course.  Everyone will be given 4 late passes to extend homework due dates for full credit! However, you can only extend a due date by one week. This is to make sure you do not fall too far behind and to make sure we are all ready to participate in class.    My Expectations     Show an attitude of respect toward everyone in the classroom. Racist, sexist, antisemitic, Islamophobic, or pornographic content is never allowed.    Complete homework assignments carefully, thoughtfully, and on time.    Prepare for assessments successfully. Make sure you test yourself before I do!    Attend help sessions and form study groups for extra help.    For each credit hour spend at least two hours working on the material outside of class. For us that means at least eight hours of work per week outside of class.    Read all covered sections of the textbook. Reading is absolutely crucial to learning Abstract Algebra. You cannot learn to write proofs without reading examples of successful proofs.       Academic Integrity  Integrity is essential to academic life. Consequently, students who enroll at Framingham State University agree to maintain high standards of academic honesty and scholarly practice. They shall be responsible for familiarizing themselves with the published policies and procedures regarding academic honesty. Common infractions of the Policy on Academic Honesty in mathematics courses include, but are not limited to:   Plagiarism: claiming as one's own work the published or unpublished literal or paraphrased work of another. It should be recognized that plagiarism is not only academically dishonest but also illegal;     Use of dishonest procedures in computer, laboratory, studio, or field work;    Cheating on exams, tests, quizzes, assignments, and papers, including the giving or acceptance of these materials and other sources of information without the permission of the instructor(s);    Unauthorized collaboration with other individuals in the preparation of course assignments;       Generative AI   Use of Generative AI is prohibited because this emerging technology cannot do mathematics. It can only mimic mathematics and lead learners astray.    Antiracism at FSU  At Framingham State University, faculty, staff, and students work together to sustain a learning, working, and living community free from hate, discrimination, harassment, and intolerance. We recognize the damaging effects of systemic racism - including policies, structures, and historic practices - on the experience and success of communities of color. Coming from different backgrounds and different levels of privilege, we can all affirm and engage in antiracist work.  Diversity of voices, and of minds, strengthens our ability to solve problems and to ask and answer questions about the world we share. As your instructor, I commit to upholding community values of inclusion, civility, accessibility, and mutual respect. I expect this class to commit to creating a community that affirms and welcomes all persons from diverse backgrounds and experiences, and supports the realization of everyone's potential.    Sexual Harassment  Framingham State University is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy learning, living and working environment that is free from all forms of sexual violence, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and retaliation. If you or someone you know has experienced any form of sexual or gender-based misconduct, we urge you to visit the SHAPE website for information regarding on-campus and community resources, University policy, contact information for the Title IX Coordinators, confidential and non-confidential reporting options, victim rights, and more.    Notice of Non-Discrimination and Diversity  Framingham State University is committed to a policy of non-discrimination, equal opportunity, diversity, and affirmative action. The University is dedicated to providing educational, working, and living environments that value the diverse backgrounds of all people. Furthermore, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (``MCRA,'' M.G.L. c. 12, §§ 11H, 11I, 11J) protects the rights of all residents of and visitors to Massachusetts to be free from bias-motivated threats, intimidation, and coercion that interfere with their civil rights. The MCRA protects the right to attend school, live peacefully, and enjoy other basic rights.    Syllabus Changes  The instructor reserves the right to make changes to this syllabus. Any changes will be announced to the class in a timely manner.     Frequently Asked Questions   How can I get extra help learning the material?  I encourage you to come to Student Help Hours whenever you have questions. Make sure to see me as soon as possible if you feel that you are falling behind.   CASA also provides math tutoring. Follow the link for their tutoring schedule.    What if I need academic accommodations like extra time or a reduced distraction environment for exams?  Any student eligible for and requesting academic accommodation due to a disability is requested to provide Documentation Confirmation from Disability\/Access Services within the first two weeks of the beginning of class. Disability\/Access Services is located in the Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA). Please email disabilityservices@framingham.edu if you have questions or if you need to schedule an appointment.    What if I am struggling with food or housing insecurity?  Visit the Rams Resource Center in West Hall 105 for non-perishable food items and toiletries.  To support students who are facing temporary or chronic homelessness and\/or difficulty affording food, we have established a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) staff person to assist students with navigating campus and local resources. If you or someone you know needs help, please contact Olivia Fenty at (508) 626-4767, ofenty@framingham.edu , or stop by the Dean of Students Office. The Dean of Students Office is located on the 5th floor of the McCarthy Center in Suite 504.    What if I need a letter of recommendation?  I routinely write letters of recommendation for students. It's part of my job! If you need a letter of recommendation please email me and I will let you know whether or not I can write one for you. Note: I usually need at least two weeks to be able to write a quality letter.    What other help is available on campus?
