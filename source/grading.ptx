      <title>Homework</title>

      <p>
        Homework is your opportunity to practice with feedback.
        I expect that you work on the homework frequently.
        Do not expect to complete assignments in a single sitting.

        There are many outside resources (some good/bad and some ethnical/unethical) for completing math homework.
        You should work on the homework in a way that prepares you for exams.
        Our brains do not retain information that we don't work for.

      <title>Standards-Based Grading (SBG)</title>

      <p>
    This semester 50% of your grade will be based on how many of the learning objectives you complete during the quizzes and exams.
      </p>



<p>
  <alert>How will my Course Objectives grade be determined?</alert>

Each objective will be scored on a 4-point scale and averaged like your GPA.
</p>

%\medskip
%
%Excellent (4 pts)
%\quad Proficient (3 pts)
%\quad Competent (2 pts)
%\quad Developing (1 pt)
%\quad Not Assessed (0 pts)

  <p>
  <alert>How many reattempts do I have for each objective?</alert>
    You will have at most two attempts at each objective during the semester.
You will also only be able to complete so many objectives during the in-person exams and that will provide a limit on how many reattempts there are by the end of the semester.
You will want to successfully complete some objectives on the first try to avoid falling behind.
Also, the cumulative final exam is a third attempt at (most) objectives!
</p>



<p>
  <alert>What is great about this?</alert>
  If you do not do well on the first attempt but you go back and learn the material, your better second attempt will be your grade!
Knowing the material is the important thing and I do not want to penalize you for a mistake while learning.
</p>




  <p>
    <alert>Where do students go wrong with this style of grading?</alert>
  They focus too strongly on only the reattempts and save the new material for later.
  This then means they get a 0 on the first attempt and are back to the old style of grading where there is no chance to improve from a constructive first attempt.

      <title>Final Exam</title>

      <p>
        The final exam will be cumulative.
        As you work through the semester, always keep this in mind.
        You need to grow beyond basic understand to see things at a deeper level.
        That is how you will retain them and be able to succeed on new problems!
